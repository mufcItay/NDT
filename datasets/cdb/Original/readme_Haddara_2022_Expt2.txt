Subjects
A total of 75 people completed this study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk over seven days.

Stimulus
Subjects made a perceptual judgement concerning whether the letter X or O occurred more frequently in a 7 x 7 grid. In the Stimulus column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class was the dominant one in the grid for that trial. 1 means that there were more X's in the grid, 2 means there were more O's in the grid. The dominant stimulus class was randomly determined on each trial, with the proportion of the dominant stimulus within the 7 x 7 grid fixed across trials at 31/49.

Response
In the �Response� column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class participants selected on each trial (X or O).

Confidence
A confidence rating using a 4-point scale was used.

Feedback
Whether or not trial-by-trial error feedback (Correct/Wrong) was provided was the main manipulation in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to a Feedback or No Feedback group and completed the perceptual task over seven sessions on different days to determine the effect of training. In the Feedback column of the .csv file, 1 means feedback was provided and 0 means no feedback was provided.

Number of trials
There were 7 sessions completed over 7 different days. Each day of the experiment included 20 blocks of 25 trials each (for a total of 500 trials per day and 3,500 in total). The first six blocks of Day 1 were used to adjust the task difficulty for each subject and were therefore excluded from analysis. 

Subject population
Adults age 18-40 using MTurk in the United States.

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Main goal
Examine the effects of trial-by-trial feedback on performance and confidence.

Main result 
Trial-by-trial feedback had no effect on both performance and confidence over seven days of training.

Experiment dates
Data were collected in May-July, 2020.

Language of data collection
English.

Location of data collection
Online via MTurk
