These data are from Experiment 4.

On each trial, participants made discrimination judgments on masked stimuli, and rated their subjective decision confidence on a continuous scale. After a fixation cross (500 ms), the target stimulus (curved or straight line, presented in white over a gray background) was presented in the center of the screen for 50 ms, followed by a mask (100 ms). Stimulus onset asynchrony was calibrated online in a 1-up-2-down procedure, with a multiplicative step factor of 0.9, and starting at 30 milliseconds. Participants then used their keyboard to make a discrimination judgment. Stimulus-key mapping was counterbalanced between participants. Following response, subjective confidence ratings were given on an analog scale by controlling the size of a colored circle with the computer mouse. High confidence was mapped to a big, blue circle, and low confidence to a small, red circle. The confidence rating phase terminated once participants clicked their mouse, but not before 2000 ms. No trial-specific feedback was delivered about accuracy. Block-wise feedback was delivered between experimental blocks about overall accuracy, mean confidence in correct responses, and mean confidence in incorrect responses.


Stimulus columns: 

* Stimulus: curved or straight lines

* Response: curved or straight

* Confidence: The subject's confidence in their response, rated on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence. Participants were told that "a large circle means you are certain that you got it right, and a small circle means there's a good chance you might be wrong."

* RT_dec: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and response.

* RT_conf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between response and confidence rating.

* SOA: Stimulus Onset Asynchrony. Temporal interval between stimulus and mask, in ms.

* Accuracy: Response accuracy.

* Trial: Serial number of trial.




Block size: 16 trials per block.


Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided. Block-wise feedback was provided about accuracy, confidence in correct responses, and confidence in incorrect responses.
