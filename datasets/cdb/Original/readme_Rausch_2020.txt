Stimulus: A sinusoidal grating oriented either horizontally or vertically, followed by a mask after varying stimulus-onset-asynchronies. 1 means vertical and 2 means horizontal.

Confidence scale: 4-point confidence scale. The four confidence categories were labelled as "not at all", "a little", "nearly sure" and "sure".

Manipulations: Stimulus-onset-asynchrony between target stimulus and mask: 16.7, 33.3, 66.7, or 133 ms

Block size: 1 training block and 24 experimental blocks, 40 trials each

Feedback: After incorrect responses only. 

Subject population: age 18-36, 4 males, 21 females

Response device: Keyboard

Experiment setting: Lab

Training: 1 Block. 1 = training, 0 = main experiment

Experiment goal: to test if three ERP components (P3, ERN, Pe) are correlates of decision confidence 

Main result: The statistical properties of the stimulus-locked P3 are consistent with those of decision confidence, but the statistical properties of ERN and Pe are different. 

Special instructions: report orientation and your degree of confidence as accurately as possible
