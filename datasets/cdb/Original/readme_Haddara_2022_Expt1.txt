Subjects
A total of 443 people completed this study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (an additional 6 subjects completed the task but their data files were corrupted).

Stimulus
Experiment 1: Subjects made a perceptual judgement concerning whether the letter X or O (Task 1) or the color red or blue (Task 2) occurred more frequently in a 7 x 7 grid. In the Stimulus column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class was the dominant one in the grid for that trial. For Task 1: 1 means that there were more X's in the grid, 2 means there were more O's in the grid. For Task 2: 1 means that there were more red circles in the grid, 2 means there were more blue circles in the grid. The dominant stimulus class was randomly determined on each trial, with the proportion of the dominant stimulus within the 7 x 7 grid fixed across trials at 31/49 for Task 1 and 27/49 for Task 2.
Experiment 2: A new sample of subjects completed Task 1 from Experiment 1 over seven different days.

Response
In the Response column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class participants selected on each trial (X or O for Task 1, red or blue for Task 2).

Confidence
A confidence rating using a 4-point scale was used.

Feedback
Whether or not trial-by-trial error feedback ("Correct"/"Wrong") was provided was the main manipulation in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to a Feedback or No Feedback group and completed the two perceptual tasks (Task 1 and Task 2). In Task 2, neither group received feedback on their perceptual decisions in order to determine whether any putative improvements would generalize to a new task. In the Feedback column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (0 or 1) indicates the trials for which feedback was given: 1 means feedback was provided and 0 means no feedback was provided.

Number of trials
Experiment 1: 480 total trials. Task 1 was 330 trials and Task 2 was 150 trials. All trials were completed in a single session.
Experiment 2: There were 7 sessions completed over 7 different days. Each day of the experiment included 20 blocks of 25 trials each (for a total of 500 trials per day and 3,500 in total). The first six blocks of Day 1 were used to adjust the task difficulty for each subject and were therefore excluded from analysis. 

Subject population
Adults age 18-40 using MTurk in the United States.

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Main goal
Examine the effects of trial-by-trial feedback on performance and confidence.

Main result 
Trial-by-trial feedback reduced response bias, enhanced confidence calibration and generated faster reaction times for perceptual decisions, even after seven days of training.

Experiment dates
