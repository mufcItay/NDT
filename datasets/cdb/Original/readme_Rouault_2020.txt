Experiment setting: In lab.

Experiment goal: (1) estimate individualsâ€™ metacognitive abilities and (2) build a confidence model for use in the analysis of in-scanner data.

Stimulus: Participants were briefly presented with two boxes, each containing a number of small squares. There were two difficulty levels corresponding to the square difference between left and right boxes, that were adjusted for each participant using a calibration procedure performed beforehand.

Manipulations: There were two fixed difficulty levels for the perceptual judgement.

Response: Participants were asked to select the box that contained the more squares (left or right box). There was a maximum of 1500 ms for providing a response.

Confidence scale: We used a 6-point scale for confidence ratings (from 1 (relatively low confidence) to 6 (relatively high confidence)). There was a maximum of 3500 ms for providing confidence ratings.

Block size: Participants completed 200 trials, divided into three blocks, with breaks in-between blocks. 

Feedback: No feedback was provided.

NaN fields: NaN fields come from when the time limit on response and/or confidence rating were missed.

Subject population: N=41 young participants were kept for analysis when they did not respond at chance level and did not miss more than 5% of trials. Due to a technical issue two participants have only 133 instead of 200 trials. 

Training: One block of training was provided outside of the scanner.

Response device: Button box.

Experiment dates: 2018.
