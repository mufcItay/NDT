Stimulus: Moving-dot stimulus. In a black circle (8 degree; gray background), a large number of white dots were moving in random directions while a certain proportion of dots were moving toward either left or right direction. The task was to figure out the direction of the coherently moving dots.

Confidence scale: 1-4 (lowest to highest)

Manipulation: In the control condition, the coherently moving dots were consistently moving toward the target direction. However, in the volatility condition, the coherently moving dots moved to the opposite direction of the target in some frames (SD = .256). The control and volatility conditions were interleaved.

Conditions: In the dataset, Condition column indicate volatility conditions. No volatility (low volatility) condition is 0, and high volatility condition is 1.

Block size: 16 blocks (4 runs of 4 blocks)

Feedback: Feedback was not given in the main experiment.

NaN fields: Last block in the third run of Subject 4 was not collected.

Subject population: NEEDS TO BE FILLED

Response device: Computer keyboard

Experiment setting: In lab

Training: The training session first explained a single trial step-by-step. Then subjects underwent 60 trials with high coherence level (30 trials with 40% and 30 trials with 20%). After then, two blocks of training trials were presented to find the threshold coherence level of individual subject. To find the threshold, 2-up-1-down staircase process was used. After finding the threshold, a 40-trials of last practice block was presented.

Experiment goal: We wanted to examine dissociation effect of decision and confidence responses between the control and volatility conditions.

Main result: The volatility condition showed lower accuracy (78.24%) but higher confidence level (2.61) than the control condition (Accuracy = 82.43%; Confidence = 2.49).
