Distinct neural contributions to metacognition for detecting, 
but not discriminating visual stimuli. eLife 2020;9:e53900

Stimulus: In discrimination trials, the target was a circle 
of diameter 3° containing randomly generated white noise, 
merged with a sinusoidal grating (2 cycles per degree; 
oriented 45° or −45°, coded as 0 and 1 in the stimulus column, 
respectively). In half of the detection trials, targets did
not contain a sinusoidal grating and consisted of random 
noise only (coded as 0 in the stimulus column).

Response: In discrimination trials, participants responded 
'clockwise' or 'anticlockwise' (coded as 0 and 1 in the 
stimulus column, respectively). In detection trials, 
participants responded 'yes' or 'no' (coded as 1 and 0 in
the response column, respectively).

Orientation: Grating orientation is indicated only for 
Detection 'present' trials in the Orientation column.

Confidence scale: A 1-6 scale from 'guess' to 'certain'. 
Participants used two keys to increase and decrease their 
reported confidence level, indicated by the size and color 
of a circle. For a confidence rating of 3, participants won
3 points if they were correct and lost 3 points if they were
incorrect. Similarly for all other confidence levels.
RT_conf is not available as the confidence rating phase
always terminated after 2.85 seconds. The column Conf_presses 
lists the number of presses subjects executed in reporting 
their confidence. 

Manipulations: These data were collected inside an MRI scanner
while functional brain scans were acquired. Discrimination and 
Detection trials were delivered on different 40 trial blocks.

Block size: 40 trials. 

Feedback: no feedback was delivered.

NaN fields: trials in which participants failed to respond 
within their 1.5 second window are coded as NaN.

Subject population: participants were young adults (ages 18–36, 
mean = 24 ± 4; 29 females and 17 males).

Response device: MRI compatible response boxes. 

Training: Prior to scanning subjects took part in a 75 minute
instruction and training session. Training sessions took place
on a separate day.

Experiment goal: Compare neural correlates of decision
confidence in detection and discrimination, and within detection 
in 'yes' and 'no' responses.
