Experiment goal:
To test how information about the outcome of a movement affects the accuracy of performance-monitoring. Thus, participants performed a motor task in which we manipulated the outcome information available.

Task:
The experimental task consisted of a version of the skittles game (see ‘Skittles task’ under ‘Other important information’). In the task, participants throw a virtual ball at a target and see a virtual representation of the ball and the lever – the target disappears the moment the ball is released so participants do not have explicit information about the outcome of their throw.

After each throw, participants view a static Skittles scene displaying two plausible trajectories of the ball. One of the trajectories corresponded to the actual movement performed while the other was a slight modification of the angular velocity parameter (determined by an online staircasing procedure; see ‘Difficulty’ and ‘Staircase procedure’). Participants had to make a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) discriminating which of the two trajectories corresponded to their actual movement. Immediately after the 2AFC, participants rated their confidence (see ‘Confidence scale’)

Stimulus:
Participants see a static Skittles scene where two plausible trajectories are represented with dotted lines. The task is to determine which is the real trajectory. To select a trajectory, participants rotated the lever, and every 20 degrees of rotation would select the other trajectory (indicated by a thicker dotted line). Which trajectory appeared thicker first was pseudo-randomised. To commit their response, participants placed their finger on the lever’s sensor. The selection of the left or right trajectory was encoded as: left = 1; right = 0). 

Difficulty:
The difficulty of the task was determined by the difference in ball release velocities for the real and the alternative trajectory (the smaller the difference the harder the task). Unit: m/s. This was adaptively manipulated using two separate online staircase procedures, one for each condition (see staircase procedure).

Confidence scale:
Participants rated their confidence using a mouse to move a cursor on a continuous vertical scale ranging from very confident (top) to not confident (bottom). The starting position of the cursor on the continuous scale was pseudo-randomised.

Manipulations:
There were two conditions.
1) Congruent condition: the alternative trajectory always has the same outcome as the real one. Simply put, if participants hit (miss) the target with their ball throw, the alternative trajectory shown also hits (misses) the target. 
2) Incongruent condition: If participants hit the target, the alternative ball trajectory misses the target, and vice versa.


Block size:
Participants completed 4 blocks with 136 trials each (544 trials in total). 

Feedback:
Participants did not receive any feedback on their performance.

Missing data:

Subject population:
41 participants (age: 27.8 ± 5.08, sex: 29 female)

Response device:
Skittles lever (see Apparatus section). To select a trajectory, participants rotated the lever in either direction, and every 20 degrees rotation would select a different trajectory (indicated on the screen by a thicker line). The order of which trajectory appeared thicker at the beginning of the first-order task was pseudo-randomised at the beginning of the experiment. Participants placed their index finger on the sensor to commit their response.

Experiment setting:
In lab.

Training:
40 training trials followed by 8 feedback trials.

Experiment goal:
To investigate whether discrimination, confidence, and metacognitive efficiency in a 2AFC differ when discriminating between stimuli that have the same outcome as the movement performed (ie. congruent condition where both trajectories hit or miss the target) and when discriminating stimuli with different outcomes (ie. incongruent condition).


Main findings:
Participants completed trials in two conditions, that differed on whether the two trajectories shown matched (Congruent) or differed (Incongruent) in terms of hitting the target or not. Participants had better discrimination perfromance in the Incongruent condition and, accordingly, were significantly more confident in these trials. However, there was no significant difference at the metacognitive level (measured as metad’/d’) between the two conditions. Interestingly when we split the data according to the outcome of their movement we found that in the Incongruent condition participants had higher metacognitive performance when they hit the target. Taken together these results indicate that participants successfully incorporated information about the outcome of the movement for their discrimination and confidence responses. Information about the outcome sharpened the precision of confidence ratings only when the outcome of their throw matched their intention.


Special instructions:
Subjects were instructed to use the full confidence scale and be as precise in their confidence ratings as possible.

Other Important Information

Staircase procedure:
Two online staircase procedures were used simultaneously. 
1) Target hit rate staircase: a 1-up, 1-down online staircasing procedure to adaptively determine the size of the ball and target, in order to keep participant’s rate of hitting the target at approximately 0.5.
2) Alternative velocity staircase: Two separate 2-down, 1-up online staircases (one for each condition) were used to control the difference between the real velocity and the alternative velocity, to keep accuracy in the first order task at approximately 71%.

In order to give precedence to the staircasing procedure, if the corresponding velocity difference was incompatible with the trial condition then the trial changed condition and the following trial of the opposite condition changed in order to keep conditions balanced. Despite the condition swapping of subsequent trials, there was a slight imbalance in the amount of trials per condition (congruent condition: 246 ±18 trials; incongruent: 219 ±38 trials).

Skittles task:
Our version of the skittles task is an adaptation from Müller & Sternad (2004) and was programmed using Matlab (MathWorks R2016b, Natick, MA.) and Psychtoolbox-3 (Brainard, 1997; Locke et al., 2020; Pelli, 1997). In the task, participants swing a ball around a pole as if it was attached to the tip of the pole with a rope. The objective is to hit a target (the skittle) on the other side of the pole. Participants view the virtual scene from a bird’s eye view, which includes the lever (represented by a rectangle that rotates around its end), a large circle at the center (the central pole), the target (a circle placed behind the pole, right to the midline so participants throw to the right side), and the ball.

In a trial, participants pick up the ball and swing it around the pole by extending their elbow and removing their finger from the tip of the lever at the moment of release. The flight trajectory is calculated using two parameters: the angular velocity and the angle of the lever at the moment of release(Müller & Sternad, 2004; Sternad et al., 2011). The ball was then shown for 0.6 seconds, which was the time it took to make a complete flight around the pole. In our task, the target disappeared at the moment of release so participants did not receive any explicit information on whether they hit the target.


Apparatus:
Participants sat approximately 60cm away from an LCD monitor (2560 x 1440 pixels, 61 x 34.5 cm, refresh rate 60 Hz) and rested their right hand on a custom-made lever, which could rotate on a vertical axis under the participant’s elbow, allowing them to bend and straighten their elbow on the horizontal plane. To record the angle of the lever (i.e., of participants’ elbows), we used a goniometer (Novotechnik, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, RFC4800 Model 600, 12 bit resolution, 0.1o precision) placed on the rotation axis of the lever. Additionally, the lever had a touch-switch at the distal end. Participants “grabbed” the virtual ball by placing their index finger on the tip of the lever, and released it by lifting their finger. We recorded data from the lever using a Labjack T7 data acquisition device (LabJack Corp., Lakewood, CO) with a sampling rate of 1 kHz.

Duration:
Each session lasted approximately 2 hours.
