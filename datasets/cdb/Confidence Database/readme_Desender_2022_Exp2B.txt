These data are from Experiment 2B. Note, due to COVID-19 data were collected online.

Stimulus: Participants decided which of two boxes contained most dots. Dot difference was continuously adapted using an online staircase. The column "Difficulty" gives the dot difference for each trial.  

Manipulations: there were no manipulations

Confidence Scale: six-point scale ("certainly wrong","probably wrong","guess wrong","guess correct","probably correct","certainly correct")

Block size: Participants completed 26 practice trials (note that these were not saved), followed by 10 blocks of 50 trials.

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: The task started with 26 practice trials identical to the main experiment.
