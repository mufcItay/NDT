These data are from Experiment 1.

Stimulus: On each trial participants judged the average color of eight elements (i.e. following de Gardelle & Summerfield, 2011, PNAS) deciding whether the average was red or blue. We manipulated the mean (high vs low) and variance (high vs low) of the eight elements.

Manipulations: There were two conditions (refered to in the column Condition): i) Free-choice, during which participants could freely choose to see the stimulus again (coded as "3"), or to give their response (coded as "1"), and ii) forced-choice during which participants were forced to select the "Give Response" option (coded as "0")

Confidence Scale: Continuous scale running from "sure red" over "guess" to "sure blue", which is then transformed into 50 (guess) to 100 (sure correct)

Block size: Participants completed 6 practice blocks (64 trials each) followed by 9 main blocks (64 trials each). Each main block started with 8 practice trials (with feedback) to maintain a stable criterion

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: The task started with 64 practice trials (binary choices with feedback), followed by 5 blocks of 64 trials (choice and confidence in a single response, no feedback), followed by one block of 64 trials (identical to the main experiment).
