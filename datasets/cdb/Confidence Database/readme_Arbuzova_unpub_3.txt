Tasks:
Subjects were tested on three different tasks that were done in two separate sessions on different days. The order of tasks was pseudo-randomized between subjects. One of the tasks, the skittles task, had two conditions: motor and visuomotor (conditions were pseudorandomly interleaved within blocks).
Visuomotor: Participants throw a virtual ball while seeing a virtual representation of the ball and the lever they use to perform the action. Then, they decide which angle of release belongs to the preceding throw.
Motor: Same as the visuomotor condition except that the critical visual information (i.e. the bar representing the lever) is not visible.
Visual: Participants discriminated which of two stimuli (presented side-by-side) had brighter lines.
Memory: Participants observed a number of stimuli in an encoding phase. Then, on each trial of a recall phase, they discriminate which of two stimuli (presented side-			by-side) they have seen before.


Stimulus:
Skittles task (motor and visuomotor): Two levers are shown, one of which has the real angle at the moment of the ball release and the other one an altered one. The task is to choose the lever with the real angle. There are two possible stimuli (i.e. relative positions of the real lever on the screen): 1 = left, 2 = right.
Visual: Two images are shown side-by-side. Each image is a pattern of white lines against a black background. Both images are identical except that they differ in the brightness level of the lines. 1 = left, 2 = right.
Memory: Two images are shown side-by-side. One of them has been presented before, during the encoding phase, the other is new. The images were similar to those in the visual task, however all lines had the same level of brightness. 1 = left, 2 = right

Difficulty:
Skittles task: The difference in angle between the real and the altered lever position. The smaller the difference, the more difficult. Unit: degrees (°).
Visual: The difference in brightness between the two images.
Memory: Number of stimuli in the encoding phase.


Confidence Scale:
Discrete confidence scale with ratings from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest), with a step of 1. 


Block size:
Skittles: 6 blocks with 64 trials each (32 per condition, pseudorandomly interleaved).
Visual: 6 blocks with 180 trials each.
Memory: 6 blocks with at least 180 trials each (the number varied because participants were tested on a different amount of stimuli each block as a method for controlling difficulty, see staircase procedure).

Feedback:
Skittles: After each block, subjects were told how many times they hit the target. No feedback on the type-1 response was given.
Visual: No feedback in the main part.
Memory: No feedback in the main part.

NaN fields:
Skittles: Subjects had the option to mark trials as "error", e.g. if they accidentally selected a different trajectory than intended. These trials are excluded. For excluded trials, the values of all response variables (Response, Confidence, RT_dec, RT_conf) are set to NaN.
The visual and memory tasks do not contain NaN fields.

Missing data:
Some subjects did not complete all tasks but all of their available data is included. The IDs of subjects that did not complete all tasks are: 1, 13, 17, 32, 33.

Subject population:
40 participants completed the study, of which 21 were female and 19 male; mean age = 26.28 (SD = 3.76).


Response device:
Skittles: Custom-made response pad with 4 keys for confidence ratings on top and 4 keys for left, right, top and bottom.
Visual: Custom-made response pad with 4 keys for confidence ratings on top and 4 keys for left, right, top and bottom.
Memory: Custom-made response pad with 4 keys for confidence ratings on top and 4 keys for left, right, top and bottom.

Experiment setting:
In the lab.

Training: 
All tasks had at least three training phases: one with feedback after each trial; one where they gave confidence ratings and received feedback; and finally, a staircasing phase that was like the test trials which served as practice and setting the initial difficulty level. The skittles task had an additional pre-training phase where participants simply attempted the throwing motion with all visual information available. All other training phases in the skittles task had equal amounts of visuomotor and motor trials.
Visual: 12 trials with feedback. 12 trials with confidence ratings. 40 staircasing trials.
Memory: Numbers of trials varied from one participant to another. 15 to 18 feedback trials, 18 to 25 confidence trials, 45 to 55 staircasing trials. 
Skittles: 8 pre-training trials, 16 feedback trials, 8 confidence rating trials, 96 staircasing trials.

Experiment goal: 
To test the proposed division between metacognitive mechanisms based on the source of information: external (like in visual perception) and internal (like in memory), by measuring metacognitive ability in a range of metacognitive tasks that can be ranked along ”internal-external” source of information axis. 


Special instructions: 
Subjects were instructed to use the full confidence scale and be as precise in their confidence ratings as possible.


Experiment dates: 12.02.2020-13.03.2020 and 10.07.2020-24.07.2020 (interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions).

Any other important information about the dataset:
Skittles task: 
In the Skittles task, subjects sit at a table next to a lever (a horizontal metal bar that rotates around its axis). The angle of the lever is recorded by a potentiometer. At the far end of the lever, a contact sensor detects whether the subject is resting their index finger on the tip of the lever (as if holding a ball) or has released it (as if having thrown a ball). Data are read from the lever into a computer using a Labjack T7 (Labjack, Lakewood, CO) at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Subjects rest their elbow on the rotation axis of the bar so that they can rotate the lever. On a screen in front of them, subjects see a short bar that moves in one-to-one correspondence to the lever (from a bird's-eye viewpoint). When the contact sensor at the end of the lever is touched, a ball is displayed at the tip of the bar on the screen. By moving the bar and lifting their index finger from the contact sensor, subjects “throw” the ball around a pole, attempting to hit a target (Skittle) standing behind it.

Difference in release velocity and angle:
Ball throw was determined by two parameters: angle and the velocity at the time of the ball release. To obtain an alternative angle, we manipulated the angle directly.

Staircase procedure:
Skittles: Both conditions were controlled with a 2-down-1-up online staircase on the critical parameter (angle difference) that affects performance.
Visual: Controlled with a 2-down-1-up online staircase on the critical parameter (brightness difference) that affects performance
Memory: The memory task was staircased by changing the number of to-be-memorized items presented in the encoding phase, increasing or decreasing by 1 if participants respond correctly to at least 80%, or less than 60% of the trials during the recall phase, respectively, averaged over the current and the previous blocks.
