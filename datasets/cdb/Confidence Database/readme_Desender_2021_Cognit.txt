Stimulus: random dot motion 

Coherence: Motion coherence could take four levels: .05, .1, .2 or .4

Manipulations: There were three conditions (refered to in the column Condition): i) participants jointly indicated choice and confidence ("sure left", "probably left", "guess left","guess right","probably right","sure right"). ii) participants first indicated their choice, and after 1s rated confidence on a six-point scale ("certainly wrong","probably wrong","guess wrong","guess correct","probably correct","certainly correct"), iii) same as ii except that the motion continued during the 1s delay 

Volatility: we manipulated the volatility of the motion coherence which was as usual (0) or more volatile (1). See paper for details

Confidence Scale: see above, depends on the condition

Block size: Participants completed 3 practice blocks (60 trials each) followed by 9 main blocks (60 trials each). Before swichting between different response modes, there was always a small block of 8 practice trials for participants to get acquinted with the task 

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: The task started with 60 practice trials (binary choices with feedback), followed by 60 more practice trials (binary choice and feedback), by 60 practice trials that were identical to the main experiment.
