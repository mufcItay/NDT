These data are from Experiment 1. Note, due to COVID-19 data were collected online.

Stimulus: random dot motion at a fixed coherence level (.2), leftwards vs rightwards motion.

Manipulations: There were two conditions (refered to in the column Condition): participants were instructed to i) focus on speed ("Speed"), or ii) focus on "Accuracy" ("Accuracy") when making their primary decision

Confidence Scale: six-point scale ("certainly wrong","probably wrong","guess wrong","guess correct","probably correct","certainly correct")

Block size: Participants completed (at least) 3 practice blocks of 24 trials each, followed by 10 blocks of 60 trials. 

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: The task started with 24 practice trials (binary choices with feedback, coherence of .5), which was repeated until participants achieved >85% correct. Next participants performed 24 practice trials (binary choices with feedback, coherence of .2), which was repeated until participants achieved >60% correct. Finally, participants performed 24 practice trials (binary choices without feedback, but with confidence rating, coherence of .2), which was repeated until participants achieved >60% correct
