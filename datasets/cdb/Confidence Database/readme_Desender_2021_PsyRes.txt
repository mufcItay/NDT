Stimulus: math assignments using two operators (- and *) and different levels of difficulty (depending on the number of items). The variable Stimulus encodes the assignment in abstract form (e.g., xx-x), the precise numbers are given by Stimulus1 and Stimulus 2, respectively. The proposed answer is given by Response, which participants then evaluated by saying whether the proposed respons was correct or not.

Confidence Scale: confidence was given both prospectively ("Confidence_prospective") and retrospective ("Confidence"), both on a six-point scale.

Manipulations: assignment difficulty was manipulated (see Stimulus)

Block size: Participants completed 6 blocks of 44 trials each. The experiment started with 3 blocks of 10 practice trials (not saved)

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: The task started with 10 practice trials (binary choice with feedback), and two blocks of 10 trials identical to the main experiment (note that practice trials were not saved)
